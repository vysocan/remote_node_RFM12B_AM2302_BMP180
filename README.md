This project should replace standard home security alarms, and route data and  statistics from various sensors. It consists from one main alarm board with atmega 1284P that has inputs for sensors and outputs to relays. 

Remote nodes act as authentication units, or they gather environment data. Currently they are set to receive iButtons as keys to arm/disarm the system.
